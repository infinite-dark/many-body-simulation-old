# Many Body Simulation

This is a simple educational project. Its purpose was to simulate and visualize a many body system of charged particles using the leapfrog algorithm.

The code is very old (about three years). Basically - it's terrible. It's a complete and utter mess, and it should be (and will be) re-written.

My intention for publishing this project on GitHub was purely technical - to share the code without resorting to manually adding project collaborators. The problem is that GitHub doesn't allow for "unlisted" repositories in the same way as, for example, YouTube allows for "unlisted" videos. I'm therefore forced to publish the repo even if I do not want to do that whatsoever (especially considering the legal issues).
