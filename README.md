# Many Body Simulation

This is a simple educational project. Its purpose was to simulate and visualize a many body system of charged particles using the leapfrog algorithm.

The code is very old (about three years). Basically - it's terrible. It's a complete and utter mess, and it should be (and will be) re-written.
